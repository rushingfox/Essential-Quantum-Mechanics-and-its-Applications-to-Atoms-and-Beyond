A Quantum Mechanics Note friendly to beginners

This is my personal notes for PHYS5730 Guided Study during CUHK's 2022 FALL semester, whose topic is Essential Quantum Mechanics and its Applications to Atoms and Beyond.
There are no reports or logs required by CUHK for Guided Study students, so I just wrote it for my personal record. Comments or discussions are welcomed!
