# Essential-Quantum-Mechanics-and-its-Applications-to-Atoms-and-Beyond
This is my personal notes for PHYS5730 Guided Study during CUHK(The Chinese University of Hong Kong)'s 2022 FALL semester, whose topic is Essential Quantum Mechanics and its Applications to Atoms and Beyond. I think it is a **beginner-friendly** Quantum Mechanics Note.

There are no reports or logs required by CUHK for Guided Study students, so I just wrote it for my personal record. Comments or discussions are welcomed!

Finally, thanks a lot to my supervisor of this course: Professor Hui Pak Ming. He has offered so much help to me and I can't express my gratitude to him just by words!
